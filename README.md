# Loan Management (Express.js, Spring Boot and MySQL)

## Run the System
We can easily run the whole with only a single command:
```bash
docker compose up
```

Docker will pull the MySQL and Spring Boot images (if our machine does not have it before).

The services can be run on the background with command:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Stop the System
Stopping all the running containers is also simple with a single command:
```bash
docker compose down
```

If you need to stop and remove all containers, networks, and all images used by any service in <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file, use the command:
```bash
docker compose down --rmi all
```

## Run following SQL insert statements

```
INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_USER');
INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_MODERATOR');
INSERT INTO roles(name) VALUES('ROLE_ADMIN');
```
